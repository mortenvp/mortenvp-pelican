      "Some time ago I came across [Mininet](http://mininet.org/) which allows us setup and emulate networks on a single machine. Mininet uses the [Linux container](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC) technology (similar to [Docker](http://docker.com)) to run multiple lightweight isolated Linux environments on a single Linux host. I never had time to play with it, but recently I wanted to experiment with a new transport protocol and see how it reacted to lossy links and Mininet seemed like an good choice for emulating the network.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mininet seems quite popular for people how wants to emulate and experiment with newer networking concepts such as SDN (Software Defined Networks). Beause the overhead of running Linux containers is very low, it allows us to emulate large networks with many connected hosts on a single computer (unfeasible with virtual machines). But, it can also be used to emulated simple networks like point-to-point links, with some loss and delay characteristics. Which is what we will do here. Another great strength of Mininet is that it allows us to run existing applications over these networks. So for example on one emulated host I can open the Firefox browser and on another host a webserver. I can even connect hosts on my emulated network to the real network and let them speak to services on the Internet. How great is that!?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let get this thing up and running.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installing mininet\n",
      "\n",
      "So the first thing we need to do is to install Mininet. There are a copule of options to choose from the easiest way it to use the prepared virtual machine. You can find additional instructions on how to set it up on the Mininet webpage [here](http://mininet.org/vm-setup-notes/). \n",
      "\n",
      "Note: The Mininet setup guide suggests that you add a \"Host-only Adapter\", when I initially tried this, it gave me a \"no host only network adapter selected\" error. This was resolve following the suggestions described [here](no host only network adapter selected).\n",
      "\n",
      "For some reason after booting the Mininet virtual machine the *host only* network was not brought up, the commands to make it accessible (run the following commands in the virtual machine):\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "sudo ip link set dev eth1 up\n",
      "sudo dhclient eth1\n",
      "ip link show\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "First we bring up the interface, then ask for an IP using DHCP and finally we show the available interfaces and their IPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively you can add the following to `/etc/network/interfaces` inside the virtual machine:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "auto eth1\n",
      "iface eth1 inet dhcp\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I could ssh from my machine to the Mininet virtual machine using:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "ssh mininet@192.168.56.101\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "To make things a bit easier I add the following to `.ssh/config`:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "Host mininet\n",
      "User mininet\n",
      "HostName 192.168.56.101\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I can login using ``ssh mininet``, see the bottom of the [Mininet VM setup notes](http://mininet.org/vm-setup-notes/) guide to see how to setup password less login.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Shared folders\n",
      "\n",
      "To make it easier to move files between the virtual machine and the host computer you can setup a shared folder. In Virtualbox go to the settings for the Mininet virtual machine and you should be able to select a host folder that you want to share in the virtual machine. In my case is just created a folder called `vm_mininet` in my home directory. \n",
      "\n",
      "To access shared folders inside the virtual machine we need to install the Virtualbox Guest Additions. Fortunately there is a package for that, so inside the Mininet virtual machine run:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-utils\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "As a final step you need to add the `mininet` user to the `vboxsf` group to have access to the folder:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "usermod -aG vboxsf mininet\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Rebooting the virtual machine, and my shared folder shows up under `/media/sf_vm_mininet`. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Creating the network\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have the Mininet virtual machine up and running we can start to emulate some networks. One of the really cool things about Mininet is how easy it is to define network topologies using Python scripts. As an example lets try to create a network with two hosts and ping from one to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The script for setting this up is available [here](./simple_ping.py). The `%%file simple_ping.py` is an iPython cell magic command that will save the content of the cell to a file called `simple_ping.py`, so that we later can runn the script in our Mininet virtual machine.\n"
