      "During the last couple of months I've started to use the iPython notebook for more and more stuff. Inspired by [Python Perambulations](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/) by Jake VanderPlas, I decided to also try to use it for blogging. In the following I'll try to document how I've setup things. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Tools involved\n",
      "\n",
      "* [Pelican](http://getpelican.com): Pelican is a static site generator, written in Python. \n",
      "* [iPython](http://ipython.com): What we will use to write our notebooks in.\n",
      "* [Docker](http://docker.com): Container for the tools \n",
      "* [Fabric](http://fabfile.org): Automates tasks like building and publishing the site.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installing Pelican\n",
      "On the GitHub README.md for the Pythonic Perambulations blog Jake VanderPlas recommonds using Pelican 3.3+. Fortunatly Ubuntu 14.10 ships with 3.4.0 (run: `sudo aptitude show python-pelican` to check). So installation is easy:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "sudo aptitude install python-pelican\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "## Hosting the site\n",
      "\n",
      "Here I will again follow the approach taken by Jake VanderPlas for his [Python Perambulations](http://jakevpd.github.io) blog. \n",
      "\n",
      "The basic idea is to create two [GitHub](http://github.com) reporitories. The first contains the Pelican project files, notebooks, and other material used when generating the site. The second contains the generated html files etc. With this approach we can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for the second repository to make the site available on the web.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first repoitory I named [mortenvp-pelican](https://github.com/mortenvp/mortenvp-pelican) and the second [mortenvp.github.io](https://github.com/mortenvp/mortenvp.github.io) which according to the GitHub Pages documentation is the mandtory name for a personal pages repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Generating the initial project\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case I just follow the Pelican [quickstart](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/quickstart.html) section to setup a basic site.\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "git clone <git-url-to-mortenvp-pelican.git>\n",
      "cd mortenvp-pelican\n",
      "pelican-quickstart\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The quick start will ask you a bunch of questions, these were my answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "Welcome to pelican-quickstart v3.4.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "This script will help you create a new Pelican-based website.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please answer the following questions so this script can generate the files\n",

      "## Choosing a theme\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not a big fan of the default Pelican theme, so instead I chose to use the [Pelican-sober](https://github.com/fle/pelican-sober) theme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the `EXTRA_HEADER` section (as described above) isn't present in the Pelican-sober theme's  `templates/base.html`, we need to add it. To do this I forked the repository to my user and made the changes there. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once this is done we can use our chosen theme by editing the `THEME` variable in `pelican.conf` (read about this [here](http://nafiulis.me/making-a-static-blog-with-pelican.html#themes)), so to summarize:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Select a theme and ensure that it has the `EXTRA_HEADER` section.\n",
      "1. Add the theme git repository as a submodule to our site repository `git submodule add git@github.com:url-to-repo.git`\n",
      "2. Add a `THEME = 'pelican-sober'` vaiable inside `pelicanconf.py`\n",

      "## Adding a post\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "One user confirmed that the error occured with Markdown 2.5 and that downgrading to 2.4 solved the issue. To verify this fix I decided to install pelican and the dependencies in a Docker container to not interfer with the system packages already on my system.\n",
