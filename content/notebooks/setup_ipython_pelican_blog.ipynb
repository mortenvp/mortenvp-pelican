      "# Creating a Pelican powered iPython notebook blog\n",
      "\n",
      "During the last couple of months I've started to use the iPython notebook for more and more stuff. Inspired by [Python Perambulations](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/) by Jake VanderPlas, I decided to also try to use it for blogging. In the following I'll document how I've setup things. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Tools involved\n",
      "\n",
      "* [Pelican](http://getpelican.com): Pelican is a static site generator, written in Python. \n",
      "* [iPython](http://ipython.com): What we will use to write our notebooks in.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installing Pelican\n",
      "On the GitHub README.md for the Pythonic Perambulations blog Jake VanderPlas recommonds using Pelican 3.3+. Fortunatly Ubuntu 14.10 ships with 3.4.0 (run: `sudo aptitude show python-pelican` to check). So installation is easy:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "sudo aptitude install python-pelican\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "## Hosting the site\n",
      "\n",
      "Here I will again follow the approach taken by Jake VanderPlas for his [Python Perambulations](http://jakevpd.github.io) blog. \n",
      "\n",
      "The basic idea is to create two [GitHub](http://github.com) reporitories. The first contains the Pelican project files, notebooks, and other material used when generating the site. The second contains the generated html files etc. With this approach we can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to make the site available on the web.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first repoitory I named [mortenvp-pelican}(https://github.com/mortenvp/mortenvp-pelican) and the second [mortenvp.github.io](https://github.com/mortenvp/mortenvp.github.io) which according to the GitHub Pages documentation is the mandtory name for a pages repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Generating the initial project\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case I just follow the Pelican [quickstart](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/quickstart.html) section to setup a basic site.\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "git clone <git-url-to-mortenvp-pelican.git>\n",
      "cd mortenvp-pelican\n",
      "pelican-quickstart\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The quick start will ask you a bunch of questions, these were my answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "Welcome to pelican-quickstart v3.4.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "This script will help you create a new Pelican-based website.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please answer the following questions so this script can generate the files\n",
      "needed by Pelican.\n",

      "> What is your URL prefix? (see above example; no trailing slash) http://blog.mortenvp.com\n",
      "> Do you want to enable article pagination? (Y/n) \n",
      "> How many articles per page do you want? [10] \n",
      "> Do you want to generate a Fabfile/Makefile to automate generation and publishing? (Y/n) \n",
      "> Do you want an auto-reload & simpleHTTP script to assist with theme and site development? (Y/n) \n",
      "> Do you want to upload your website using FTP? (y/N) \n",
      "> Do you want to upload your website using SSH? (y/N) \n",

      "> Do you want to upload your website using GitHub Pages? (y/N) Y\n",
